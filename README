These data were collected between 2016 and 2019 using 1 minute interval scan sampling observations from three groups of hooded capuchins 
across two sites in the Paraguayan Atlantic Forest. Observations of feeding were broken into 10 categories 
(Bark, Crops, Fruit, Flowers, Grass, Galls, Leaves, Insects, Roots or Vertebrates) depending on the food item being consumed by 
the capuchin. 
The dataset includes 5012 feeding records from Laguna Blanca, San Pedro and 7000 feeding records from Nueva Gambach, Itapúa.
